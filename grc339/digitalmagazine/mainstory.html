                                    <p>Creating a skincare line for all seems simple, but just think about it—most lines get boiled down to a gender, a skin type, an age bracket or a skin tone. But cousins Greg Gonzalez and Joe Cloyes knew they could do better, and that’s why they created Youth to the People. The line is truly designed for everyone. “We always learned that skin knows no gender,” Gonzalez says. “That was one of the things our grandmother always said. There was no skincare for women or men, it was just skin is skin and there’s things it’s going through depending on where you live and what are you eating, what stresses are you going through, and how you are sleeping. We had this holistic approach built into what we learned. What we wanted to do with Youth to the People is simplify the regimen but keep the professional grade efficacy.”</p>
                                    <p>For Gonzalez and Cloyes, skincare is practically in their blood. Their grandmother started her own line long before it was common for women to be entrepreneurs in the beauty business. She had seven children and five of them became estheticians or cosmetologists. Their aunt Lori and Gonzalez’s mom, Lisa, are their mentors. Youth To The People is truly a family-owned brand with three generations of skincare knowledge built into the line.</p>

                                    <p>When Youth To The People was founded in 2015 there was a wellness awakening sweeping the country, especially Los Angeles, where the brand is based. Gonzalez and Cloyes had a lightbulb moment when they realized they were drinking green juices and realized they could apply those same health perks to skincare. “We were really inspired by the way certain companies were cold pressing extracts from juices and that led to think about how can we cold press these super plants that have more antioxidants and phytonutrients, and deliver those same benefits topically,” Gonzalez says.</p>
                                    <p>Youth To The People started with ingredients like kale, green tea, spinach and alfalfa. “From there we really wanted to simplify what a high-end skincare line would look like for someone walking into a Sephora because there are so many products out there it can be confusing if you’re newer to skincare,” Cloyes says. “Part of the wellness movement was people realized they needed to take better care of their skin, just like they needed to take better care of their insides. We started with our cleanser, serum and moisture cream. The thinking was start your routine with these three products and everything will get a lot better. Because we have 40 plus years of skincare heritage in our family, there was 40 years of research behind the products, even though it’s a five-year-old company now.”</p>

                                    <p>Ingredients still drive every single launch from Youth To The People, including their newest addition. “Ingredients are our muse and when creating our new Yerba Mate Resurfacing Energy Facial, we were inspired by yerba mate, a highly-caffeinated ingredient with a culturally significant past, grown and ritually shared for centuries in South America,” Gonzalez says. “We paired yerba mate with active enzymes and physical exfoliants in a concentrated extract blend to amplify the energy facial’s performance. The result is dramatically smooth, retexturized, radiant skin in just two minutes." Cloyes adds, "This product was inspired by our 40-year family history making pro-grade formulas. We wanted to create an instant and effective resurfacing treatment for all, that mirrors the effects of a microdermabrasion facial at home." </p>
                                    <p>The duo is conscious about how everything is created, from the formulas that blend superfoods with active ingredients to the packaging to their apparel. They have always focused on sustainable packaging. “From the start we made a decision to put everything in glass,” Gonzalez says. “We’re really passionate about that being the best choice for products, just on the fact that a lot of things don’t get recycled. A lot of mixed plastics aren’t recyclable and the plants in America can’t actually recycle them even though we have consumers who think they can. Whereas glass, even if it doesn’t get recycled, is not going to leach any chemicals into the water or the earth.” They use FCS certified post-consumer boxes and are mindful about the way they kit. As technology continues to evolve, they keep their eyes open for new solutions. They’re now pushing for the lids to be made from recycled plastic instead of virgin plastic, and they’re partnering with a family-owned glass factory to control that supply chain and reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

                                    <p>Philanthropy is built into the DNA of the brand, which is something Gonzalez and Cloyes learned from their family. “When we launched the brand, it’s about more than just superfoods or one specific product,” Cloyes says. “What can we do as a company to embrace all the change and positive things that are going on in the world and to be a part of it? As the company grows, now we’re able to do more than just talk about it or donate our time. We can also donate finances and have partnerships like we do with Pride and Earth Day.” They have a full-time director of giving who runs initiatives and researches potential partners. They also like to think locally; right now they are partnered with a women’s homeless shelter that is close to their Los Angeles office and hosting a sock drive. “It’s the right thing to do,” Cloyes says. “Now that we’ve seen some success as a company we’d like to do more, which is really exciting. Any one individual can go and help these organizations. You don’t have to be a large company. But sometimes it’s hard for a person to know which ones to support. If we can do that, it’s going to make a lot of change.”</p>
                                    <p>Even their clothing has that mindfulness. Youth To The People teamed up with Upcycle so that everything would be made locally in Los Angeles. “If you’re going to buy a sweatshirt or apparel, we want it to match the standards of if you bought our cleanser,” Gonzalez says. For example, their sweatshirt was made using 15 plastic bottles, along with a blend of post-consumer organic cotton, which is leftover cuts from cotton mills or other clothing factories.

                                    <p>For Gonzalez and Cloyes, clean and ethical beauty goes far beyond what’s in a bottle. “It’s not only what’s in the product, but what does it come in?” Gonzalez says. “It’s a full thing. It has to be clean for the environment, but consciously creating products that are to the highest quality and safety standards. We don’t cut any corners.”</p>

                                    To give us all some credit, we’re sure a lot of us SPF enthusiasts are doing it correctly. Maybe even overdoing it. Which to us, is correct. One can never have too much sun protection! But there are many of us out there haphazardly slapping on the SPF sparingly, here and there, just to say we did it. Most often, that’s like not doing it at all.

                                    Similarly to foot reflexology, we can pay attention to, treat, and be informed by different areas on the face that pertain to different bodily organs and systems.
