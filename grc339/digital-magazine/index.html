                                    <p>Creating a skincare line for all seems simple, but just think about it—most lines get boiled down to a gender, a skin type, an age bracket or a skin tone. But cousins Greg Gonzalez and Joe Cloyes knew they could do better, and that’s why they created Youth to the People. The line is truly designed for everyone.</p>

                                    It can be difficult to measure the real influence of influencers, but not what it comes to Negin Mirsalehi. At this peak in her professional career, she’s less an “influencer” by traditional definitions and more of a bonafide beauty mogul. With the launch of her hair care brand Gisou in  2015, Mirsalehi has used her platform and Gisou’s products to elevate awareness about bee conservation.
