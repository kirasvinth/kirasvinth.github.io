        <h1>Bodoni vs. Didot</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>
			 <h3>Didot</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->

             <p>Didot is a serif typeface designed by Firmin Didot, a successful print shop owner, in Paris between 1784 and 1811 for use in the printing business. The typeface is known for its increasing stroke contrast and condensed armature. It is considered to be a neoclassical font, just like the similar Bodoni. There have been several iterations of the typeface over the years, notably Linotype Didot by Adrian Frutiger in 1991, and CBS’s commissioned re-drawing of the font in 1996. Today, the font consists of 12 weights including oldstyle figures and graphic elements.</p><p>
            Didot has a few key differences from its peer Bodoni. The dollar sign has a single line crossing the ‘S’, the upper-case ‘J’ sits on the baseline, the top of the upper-case ‘W’ has three upper terminals, and the four is open. Didot is still widely considered one of the most fashionable fonts in typographic history.</p>

			 <h3>Bodoni</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>Bodoni is a serif typeface originally designed by Giambattista Bodoni
in 1798. Bodoni was an expert printer and showcased the quality of his work in metal-casting and printing in his shop in Parma. The typeface
was first designed in the eighteenth century but has since been revised as people produce revivals and variants. Giambattista Bodoni gained inspiration from peers such as John Baskersville and Firmin Didot.</p><p>
It was used in many Italian books and publications at first. In more recent years it has been used in advertising, movie posters,
restaurant menus and more. Bodoni is seen often in fashion and
architecture magazines. In relation to its versatility, Bodoni is
described that “it is simple enough to work for many things, but
stylistic enough to make an impression.
Bodoni is a modern style with a striking contrast between thick and
thin strokes. It has geometric forms with rounded sides that gives it
a fashionable feel. A striking quality of this font is its abrupt,
hairline serifs.</p>
